Discord Hack Week Bot


![](images/hack_badge_black.png)

## You'll need to make a configy.py file for this, using the example one.
It'll control certain toggles like:
- TOKEN is where you put the bot token
- BOT_PREFIX controls the command prefix for the bot
- BOT_PING_CREDITS controls whether the `babble @user` quotes attribute them with a mention
- DEBUG controls console debug statements
- ALLOW_SENTENCE_MENTIONS if turned off, allows sentences to @ users.
